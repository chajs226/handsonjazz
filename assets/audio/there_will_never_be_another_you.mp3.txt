# Sample Audio Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the actual audio file: "There Will Never Be Another You"

In a real implementation, this would be an MP3 or other audio format file.
The audio file should contain the jazz standard recording that matches 
the timing data in the corresponding JSON file.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Replace this file with an actual audio file of the same name
2. Ensure the audio duration matches the JSON data (180 seconds)
3. Verify the chord changes align with the specified timestamps

Audio format recommendations:
- MP3 (recommended for mobile apps)
- AAC
- WAV (larger file size)

Sample file structure:
- Bitrate: 192 kbps or higher
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz
- Duration: 3:00 (180 seconds)
